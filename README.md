## The Types of Software Development
### Waterfall 
The waterfall software development method describes a process that follows certain stages in a linear downward order (like a waterfall), with little flexibility, meaning that to progress to the next step you must complete the one prior, you cannot jump between stages. The stages are, in order:
* Requirement gathering and analysis: The required resources for the project are developed and are documented.
* System Design: The requirements from the previous stage are studied and the system is then designed, the design helps specify what hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the architecture of the system.
* Implementation: With inputs from the system design, the system is the designed in small parts called units. Each unit is developed and tested for functionality.
* Integration and testing: All the units developed in the last phase are then integrated into the same system, the entire system is then tested for any errors.
* Deployment of the system: Once the system has been fully developed, the product is then released to the consumer market
* Maintanence: The system may still encounter errors while being released, these errors can be corrected by released patched versions of the system.
