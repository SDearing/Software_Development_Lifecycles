## The Different Types of Software Life Cycles
### Waterfall Model
#### What is the Waterfall Lifecycle?
The waterfall software development lifecylce describes a sequential process that follows certain stages in a linear downward order (like a waterfall), with little flexibility, meaning that to progress to the next step you must complete the one prior and you cannot jump between stages. The logical nature of the sequential process in the waterfall method is why the waterfall method is commonly used as the design process in the industry, however this model is more recently being . The stages are, in order:
* Requirement gathering and analysis: The required resources for the project are developed and are documented.
* System Design: The requirements from the previous stage are studied and the system is then designed, the design helps specify what hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the architecture of the system.
* Implementation: With inputs from the system design, the system is the designed in small parts called units. Each unit is developed and tested for functionality.
* Integration and testing: All the units developed in the last phase are then integrated into the same system, the entire system is then tested for any errors.
* Deployment of the system: Once the system has been fully developed, the product is then released to the consumer market
* Maintanence: The system may still encounter errors while being released, these errors can be corrected by released patched versions of the system.
#### Advantages of the Waterfall Lifecycle
While the waterfall method is losing popularity over the years, it can still provide a number of benefits, particularly for larger projects and businesses that require the stringent stages and deadlines included with this method.
* Forces Structured Organization: The waterfall model forces the project, even the team working on the project, to be very disciplined in its design and structure. Most large projects will need to include detailed procedures to manage all aspects of the project from the requirement gathering to the maintanence of the project.
* Allows Early Design Changes: As the beggining stages of the model are focused on planning for development, alterations to the project can be made during these stages, since no coding or implementation has actually taken place. However it is more difficult to to make changes in the later stages of the model.
* Suited for Milestone-Focused Development: As the waterfall model is set in a linear structure, it is suited for teams that work well under a milestone and date-focused work paradigm. The model allows teams to understand and prepare for each stage of the process, and to easily create a time line for the entire process and assign particular milestones in said timeline.
* Suited for Large Software Development Projects: 
#### Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model
* Nonadaptive Design Constraints: The biggest flaw of the waterfall lifecycle is its inherent lack of adaptability in all of its stages. For instance if in the testing stage of the model reveals a fundamental flaw in the software, it would require a dramatic leap backwards in the lifecycle which would then force the team to go back through the respective stages again, dramatically increasing the work time of the development of the software and interfering with any planned deadlines.
* Ignores Mid-process User/Client Feedback: Due to the strict nature of the step-by-step process enforced by the cycle, a issue that is hard to solve is that the user feedback is only given late into the lifecycle, and can even be given too late. If an unforseen requirement or a change from the client is discovered the project will be forced to revert to previous stages to apply the changes which would be costly and time consuming for the organization.
* Delayed Testing Period: The waterfall model only allows testing to occur until quite late in the development process. This means that most bugs/ design issues wont be discovered until very late in the lifecycle.
### Evolutionary/Iterative Lifecycle
#### What is the Evolutionary/Iterative Lifecycle?
The iterative lifecycle is a method of developing software, this method starts with a simple construction of a small set of the softwares requirements and iteratively enhances the basic software by creating evolutions of the original version until the software is fully complete and meets all the requirements. The iterative life cycle model does not start with all the specifications of the software being planned out, instead development begin by only specifying and developing a section of the software, which is then observed and tested, to see what requirements would be required to improve upon the software. This process is repeated  producing a new version at the end of every iteration, with design modifications and new functions.
#### Advantages of the Iterative Lifecycle
* Obtain Results Very Early in Development: This is because in the very early stages of development in the iterative life cycle, there is a working model, this makes finding functional or design flaws simpler. Finding these issues in early development allows the developer to fix these issues before they affect the larger versions of the software.
* Suited for Larger Projects: This is because the larger project can be broken down into seperate sections of software that can then be iteratively developed.
* Allows Customer Feedback during Devlopment: As the iterative life cycle creates multiple versions of the same software, versions can be sent to clients to obtain feedback from them, allowing the developer to see if they are developing their software in the right direction.
#### Disadvantages of the Iterative Lifecycle
* Not Suitable for Small Projects: This is because smaller projects are harder to breakdown into smaller sections to program.
